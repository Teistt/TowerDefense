Based on Tower Defense Brackey's serie with little twists.

There is 5 levels with the last one being an infinite mode.

There is 3 turrets with 1 upgrade each and 3 enemies with 1 stronger version each.

Controls:

You can pan the camera using screen borders, or left click and drag or keyboard (tested with zqsd). Click on a turret in the bottom of the screen and place it on a square. To upgrade or sell a turret, click on it. You also can zoom in action with mouse scroll.

Maybe I will update the game later, but not for now.
